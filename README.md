# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using R and the MovieLens dataset.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Collaborative Filtering (User-Based and Item-Based)
- Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Scalability and Real-Time Recommendations

## Setup

1. Install the required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages("dplyr")
   install.packages("tidyr")
   install.packages("ggplot2")
   install.packages("recommenderlab")
   install.packages("recosystem")
   install.packages("Metrics")
   install.packages("parallel")
   install.packages("caret")
   ```

**Movie Recommendation System**
_Developed an advanced movie recommendation system using R and the MovieLens dataset. Implemented various data science techniques including collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and hyperparameter tuning to deliver personalized movie recommendations. Ensured scalability and real-time recommendation delivery._

- Utilized dplyr and tidyr for data preprocessing.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis with ggplot2.
- Applied user-based and item-based collaborative filtering using recommenderlab.
- Implemented matrix factorization with SVD and ALS using recosystem.
- Evaluated models using RMSE and MAE metrics.
- Optimized model parameters through grid search and cross-validation.
- Ensured efficient processing with parallel computing.
- Integrated real-time recommendation delivery.

SHINY APP

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications directly from R. You can use Shiny to create a local app or deploy it as a web application.

install.packages("shiny")

then run app.R and wait
